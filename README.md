# Alpine-numpy-pandas-matplotlib

Image comes with numpy, pandas, matplotib preinstalled in venv

# Activate the venv using the startup script

```source startup.sh```

or

```source /venv/bin/activate```

Then run python anywhere (venv path is set once in)

```python```

This should activate and give you access to all the python packages specified in requirements.txt

I cannot work out how to get this script to run in an automatic way and keep the shell open, from Dockerfile.
